**This crate is now deprecated. You no longer need this—just declare a `fn main()` as normal.**

Ndless procedural macros for common tasks, such as marking the main
function of the program. It will automatically store the command-line
arguments, and mark the function as the entrance to the program. You
probably don't want to use this crate directly—check out [ndless]
instead.

```rust

extern crate ndless_handler;

use ndless::prelude::*;

#[entry]
fn main() {
    // Code
}
